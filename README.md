# CV-Creator
## What is it?
This is my first React project. It is a simple app that contains a section to add general information like name, email, phone number, a section to add your educational experience (school name, title of study, date of study) and section to add practical experience (company name, position title, date from and until when you worked for that company). It also contains an add experience button to add multiple experience fields. At the end you can click the Submit button to show a preview of your CV and also an Edit button that gets you back to editing mode.

## Techonolgies used:
* React
* CSS

## How to run the app
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). In the project directory, you can run:
```
npm start
```
Or you can simply visit the [live page](https://anabargau.github.io/cv-project/).
## What I learned
This was my first React project and I learned a lot of practical stuff through it, event though it was quite challenging at the beginning. At first I used class components that I changed to functionall components, just to become familiarized with both types of components.
